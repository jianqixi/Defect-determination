# Defect-determination
Count the Defect Number in Displacement Cascades, and determine the defect position
This code is used to determine the defect number using the nearest-neighboring distance method
This fortran code is based on Fusion Science and Technology, 66, 235 (2015) 
"Evolution of defects and defect clusters in Î²-SiC irradiation at high temperature"
If you use this code, please cite above reference. Thanks!
